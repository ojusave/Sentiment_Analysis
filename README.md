# Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing

This Node.js code performs sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes the `natural` library to train a Bayes classifier with sample data and allows users to enter their own sentences for sentiment analysis.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the code using the following command:
   ```
   node sentiment.js
   ```
3. Enter a sentence when prompted to analyze its sentiment.
4. The code will output the entered sentence and its sentiment classification (positive or negative).

## Example

Here is an example of running the code with user input:

```
$ node sentiment.js
Enter a sentence to analyze the sentiment: I am enjoying my day.
Input: I am enjoying my day.
Sentiment: positive
```

## Customization

To customize the sentiment analysis, you can modify the training data by adding or removing documents in the code. The current code provides a basic set of sample data for training the classifier. Feel free to expand the dataset with more positive and negative examples to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis.



The sentiment analysis code in this project utilizes the `natural` library, which is a powerful natural language processing library for Node.js. Special thanks to the authors and contributors of the `natural` library for providing a useful tool for NLP tasks.
